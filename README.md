OpenTNF™ is an open specification for interoperability and exchange of data on Transport Networks. The format enables users to read and write OpenTNF™ data files using either self-written or Open Source software. 

OpenTNF™ is and shall be free of charge, globally useful and an open complement to international standards such as INSPIRE DS TN, GDF and ISO 19100 and national standards such as SOSI (Norway) and SS63700x (Sweden). Our common goal for the work is characterized by openness and simple and effective solutions.

OpenTNF's mission statement:

_Create and maintain, as a community, an international, open and efficient solution for exchange of Transport Network data. The solution will enable easier usage of data on multiple platforms._

The OpenTNF™ format is specified as a set of data tables that in principal may be implemented in any relational database engine. An OpenTNF™ dataset is compliant with INSPIRE DS TN and may contain the following types of data:

* Transport network including the definition of linear referencing, geometric, topological and temporal aspects
* Attribution and features, here called transport properties, related to the geography and/or transport network using linear referencing mechanisms. OpenTNF™ uses a generic approach where all types use the same schema where the types are defined in a separate catalogue data structure.
* A transport property type catalogue defining the various transport property types. This catalogue may also contain definitions of secondary linear referencing systems.
* Metadata, also according to any XML compliant standard such as ISO 19139
* Update (transaction) information for the case that the dataset represents a set of updates

### OpenTNF specification

The current release of the <a href="https://github.com/OpenTNF/opentnf/blob/master/OpenTNF%20-%20white%20paper.pdf" target="_blank">OpenTNF specification</a> is available for download at [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenTNF/opentnf).

Everyone is invited to contribute to further development and maintenance of OpenTNF™. We encourage you to read, review, evaluate, use, discuss and comment this initiative and document.

Comments, problems, errors, questions, proposals etc. can be registred as  [OpenTNF Issues](https://github.com/OpenTNF/opentnf/issues).

### Activities

A statutory steering group meeting and workshop was held in Oslo at Triona’s office in Oslo 12th of December. The <a href="https://github.com/OpenTNF/opentnf/blob/master/meeting%20notes/Meeting%20notes%20OpenTNF%202018-11-20.pdf" target="_blank">meeting notes</a> is available for download.

Planned activities is as follows;

* January 15th 2019 at 10.00 (CET)  - Introduction to OpenTNF (Anders Nilsson, Triona)
* 	January 15th  2019 at 13.00 (CET)  - Comparing models for providing geospatial information from GIS to ITS databases (Knut Jetlund, Statens Vegvesen)
*	March 19th 2019 at 14.00 (CET) - Steering committee meeting
